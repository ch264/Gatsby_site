Before you start, download and [import](/docs/postman/collections/data-formats/) [collection.json](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/58793802.json) for the example we'll discuss in this topic.

## Basic workflow

Let's assume that we have a collection with four requests. If you run this collection directly, the collection runner runs all four requests in order.
